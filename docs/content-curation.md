# Content Curation Scope

This file captures what is carried forward from the legacy site and `linkedin_profile.txt`.

## Keep

- Personal headline and positioning as a DevOps engineer.
- Current employer context (`SumUp`) and public location (`Berlin`).
- Clear differentiators:
  - CKA-certified Kubernetes expertise
  - Deep Argo ecosystem knowledge (GitOps, ArgoCD)
  - Strong AWS architecture and operations depth
  - Modular Terraform implementation patterns
  - Monitoring, logging, and tracing ecosystem fluency
- High-signal project and article links relevant to platform/devops engineering.
- Public social links (`GitHub`, `LinkedIn`).

## Update

- Rewrite legacy "About" and role history with modern concise impact bullets.
- Replace old modal-based portfolio cards with project/case-study cards.
- Replace generic skills list with grouped capabilities and proof artifacts.
- Standardize blog experience under local Markdown posts.

## Remove

- Legacy Bootstrap/jQuery interactions and modal portfolio UI.
- Scraped LinkedIn noise from `linkedin_profile.txt`:
  - Sign-in prompts and duplicated login blocks
  - Feed spam and unrelated suggested posts
  - Scraped image placeholders
  - Duplicate boilerplate legal text
- Stale/expired certifications unless still useful for narrative context.
