Observability should reduce mean-time-to-diagnose, not only generate more metrics.

## Practical model

- Define service-level indicators and error budgets.
- Standardize structured logs with correlation IDs.
- Add tracing for cross-service latency and failure paths.

## Outcome

Teams spend less time guessing and more time fixing the right issue quickly.
